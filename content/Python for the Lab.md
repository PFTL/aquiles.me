# Python for the Lab
[Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com) started as the companion website of my services as a freelance software developer. Initially, I thought I would move towards offering more comprehensive solutions, such as helping scientists with [[data management]], or [[grant writing]]. Over the course of the months, it became clear that my project was focusing exclusively on developing [[Python]] programs to control experiments. 

Now a days I just prefer to say that my project after the [[PhD]] was Python for the Lab (or PFTL) even though the name came somewhat later. 

## Writing to consolidate presence and knowledge

I started writing on the website as a way of documenting what I was doing in ways the code itself does not allow you to. I started by writing very opinionated guides on how to work developing programs, or how to use specific libraries. 

I wrote a wildly successful article on the use of [[HDF5]], which still is responsible for the majority of the traffic to the site. The fact that people could easily find my tutorials started to put me in the radar. Plus, the feeling of finding someone answering a question on Stack Overflow, linking to your website generates an immense gratitude. 

Writing has also helped me iron out details I had, perhaps, a bit fuzzy in my head. Tried the edge cases, the limits, and documented what I was doing. The website is therefore one of my ways of [[learning in public]].
