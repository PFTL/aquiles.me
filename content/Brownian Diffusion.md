# Brownian Diffusion
Trying to improve my fitting algorithms for [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]], currently reading on the subject[^1].

- **Colloids are molecules**: Slightly controversial, but it points to the usefulness of challenging definitions as often as we can.

What would be the effect of considering a finite interaction time between molecules in the medium and colloids?
