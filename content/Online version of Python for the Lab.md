# Online version of Python for the Lab

Outline of the contents for a [[Python for the Lab]] course to be held online. 

## Objectives
Lay out the common patterns that one encounters in the lab. Starting from the basic ideas of communicating with a device through the serial port all the way to building a User Interface. 

## Requirements
Students should have a basic working knowledge of programming, knowing what for-loops or if-statements are. Also, students will have to get their hands on the hardware used for acquiring data: An Arduino due, three wires, a resistor, LED, and a breadboard. 

I will use PyCharm as an IDE, as I do in the face-to-face workshops. 

How can this be made more flexible?

## Strategy
Develop bite-sized videos that can be consumed by students at their own pace. Some videos (especially at the beginning) can be skipped by more experienced programmers.
