# About Aquiles

	![Aquiles Carattino](/Aquiles_Carattino.jpg)

My name is **Aquiles Carattino**. I studied [[physics]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. I moved to [[The Netherlands]] to do a [[PhD]] in the group of [[Michel Orrit]], in [[Leiden]]. During [[My PhD]] I performed a lot of experiments on [[gold nanoparticles]] using different [[microscopy]] techniques, some that I built myself, some that I developed. [^1]

When I finished my Ph.D., I decided it was time to move out of [[academia]] by starting my own business as a freelance [[software]] [[developer]] and [[trainer]]. I saw an opportunity on [[teaching]] how to use [[Python]] for controlling [[experiments]] and automating complex tasks. That process lead to the creation of [[Python for the Lab]], a project which is still alive and thriving. 

Later, together with three partners: [[Sanli Faez]], [[Steven Tan]], and [[Hans Brouwer]], we started a company to build devices to measure the [[size of nanoparticles]]. This project is a [[spin-off]] of the [[research]] done by Sanli in Germany and in The Netherlands. At [[Dispertech]], we are building the next-generation nanoparticle tracking analysis ([[NTA]]) devices. We aim at measuring particle sizes in the range of 10nm to 150nm, providing an accurate distribution and concentration. 

## Free Time and Hobbies
As any healthy person, I do have hobbies and interests that sometimes do not overlap with my professional interest. To increase the porteño cliché, I do dance [[Tango]], but don't play football. I like building [[websites]], such as this one. I like programming in [[Python]], and recently started picking up [[sailing]]. 


[^1]: Before my Ph.D. I worked for a year at [[Tenaris]] as a research assistant. My professional life didn't start within academia, and that may have been a determining factor for my career.
