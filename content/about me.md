	![Aquiles Carattino](/Aquiles_Carattino.jpg)

My name is **Aquiles Carattino**. I am a physicist who decided to resign to a PhD opportunity to work in industry for a year. I then moved to The Netherlands to start, finally, [[my phd|a PhD]]. Once done, it was time to move out of academia. I decided to start my own business: [[things I've done]]. 

Besides my scientific interests in the topics of microscopy, optics and nanoparticles, I always enjoyed programming. From Instrumentation software to websites. I am concerned with, what I consider, are the major challenges of my generation: climate and the environment, online privacy, digital education. 

I think and discuss about many topics, including: [[open source]], [[technology transfer]], [[user privacy online]], and generally speaking, [[how to make a better world]]. 

## Free Time and Hobbies
Of course, not everything in my life is about thinking solely about the biggest problems and challenges. As any healthy person, I do have hobbies and interests that sometimes do not overlap with my professional interests. I dance [[Tango]]. I like building [[websites]], such as this one. I like programming in [[Python]], and recently started picking up [[sailing]].
