# How often do we ask why?
I have been working full-time on [[Dispertech]] for almost two years already. This [[technology transfer]] project is focused on building a product that can be used (at least initially) by researchers from other areas than where the technique originated. The challenge, therefore, is transforming a prototype that sits in a physics lab to a device that can be used in a biology/bio-medicine lab. 

The *hard-core* prototype, in which every single mirror must be aligned, each lens has to be manually positioned, was useful to prove the underlying ideas. However, from the perspective of a *user*, the device must be relatively easy to use. Translating from prototype to minimum viable product includes many steps and changes to the original design in a sequence that, if we don't [[ask why]], can lead us through a series of missteps, lost time, and an overload of frustration. 

## The Multiparemetric Optimization Problem
One of the biggest challenges in many projects is to define what are we trying to achieve. In our case, the general idea of "user-friendliness" has many different approaches. Software to control the experiment must be improved, the external housing has to be nice, with informative LED's to show the status of the device. The optics must be placed in such a way that they stay aligned over time. 

However, no single thing can be optimized without impacting on the others. I can't design the electronics if I don't know how many LED's are going to be there. The housing can't look nice if the electronics don't fit inside. Moreover, we are relying on the use of disposable cartridges to hold a [[hollow optical fiber]], the core component of our device. These cartridges have many different aspects to consider, from environmental friendliness, including alignment precision, and the type of glue used. 

Each decision we made was linked to other things. Perhaps some change that looked as good idea for the housing ruins the quality of the system's read out. A slight change in the cartridge design may make its manufacturing time too long to be worth actually building it. This is the problem of **multiparametric** optimization approach for new projects.   

## Early Progress is not a Lasting Indicator
Many new projects work in such a way that there is a lot of progress at the beginning. Perhaps it is fueled by motivation, perhaps it is enabled by the amount of things that must be done and which have relatively low difficulty level. The early progress is a fantastic feeling, but is also risky to make assumptions based on it. 

When you need to manage time and cash flow, you must develop some time-frames. The early progress can easily make you overshoot with your expectations. If in the first 6 months you achieved this much, in the coming 6 you must be already at this stage. The biggest obstacle, is that *difficulty is not linear over time*. 

When quantifiable progress stops being exponential, several things will take place. The most important one is frustration. You set expectations for yourself based on what you have done up to a point. Others may project their own expectations on you or on the company. When progress fuels motivation, lack of progress not only takes it away, it also gives space to a feeling of frustration. 

## Stop and ask Why
When building something no one else has built before, there is no clear reference. You may relate to other products, but you are mostly on your own. Even after the initial phase, progress never stops completely. There are always some wins, either big or small, and plenty of learning opportunities. However, as deadlines pass by and the product is no closer to completion than before, it becomes a constant emotional struggle. 

When you reach this point, there is a timeline that brought you here. You must be aware that there were plenty of steps in one direction to arrive to where you are, even if you don't know which ones yet. This is the moment to **stop and ask why**. It is a challenging exercise, but the more often you do it in a conscious way, the better understanding you'll have about the creative process. 

Asking why means reflecting on what was the end goal of the actions you took in the past. For example, I was struggling with building disposable cartridges. They were in place to make the device *user-friendly*, and the entire ethos of what we were doing was around those cartridges. Because of the cartridges many parts of the device became too convoluted, hard to maintain and use. 

The obvious question to ask ourselves was: why are we still using the cartridges? They were the source of most of our problems. However, we built for so long on the idea that cartridges were a must-have, that it took us a very long time to step back and decide that we needed to tackle the problem in a different way.
