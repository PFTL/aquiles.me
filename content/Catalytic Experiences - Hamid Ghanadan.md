This book is a write up of the experience of Hamid Ghanadan working on marketing for large pharmaceutical companies that mostly target researchers and clinicians for customers. 

The first thing to discuss is that [[Scientists are shifting their attention from traditional to social media]]. Everyone is exposed to an increasing number of stimuli and must filter what is relevant from what is not. Traditional channels (such as cold-emailing) are failing. Trade show attendance is declining. Social media, on the other hand is on the rise, also for scientists. 

Shifting the attention means also that [[scientist are changing how they consume content]], and how they make decisions. Customers spend time researching products much before approaching a company. Being on top of the narrative, offering content and, more importantly, generating a genuine link through social media seems, therefore, like a prime approach.
