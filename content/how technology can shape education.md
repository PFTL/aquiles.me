# How technology can shape education

In the podcast [[people i mostly admire]], [[Steven Dubner]] discusses with [[Mayim Bialik]] about the role technology can have in shaping the future of education. Incredibly, they default to the technocracy approach, typical of Silicon Valley, thinking that teachers can be replaced by videos. 

The argument is as follows:

> Grab the best 100 teachers across a country, make them record videos, and distribute them to all schools. In this way, all students have access to the best teachers. 

This approach was done decades ago [^1] as an attempt to democratize the access to university education in Argentina. But it is not enough. The solution to educational problems are not constrained to a better use of technology, but to a better understanding of the science behind education, and a clear political decision to make a change. 

Having a recorded video is only a tiny (extremely tiny) part of what technology offers for education.
