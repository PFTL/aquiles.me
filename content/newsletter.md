# Newsletter
## Why
We consume a lot of content both online and offline. We judge the content and decide which things are worth sharing with others and which ones are not. This is called curating content. I thought it would be nice to share what I came across that consider worth other's time. 

## How
I have been self-hosting newsletters for other websites, but I wanted this one to be as minimalistic as possible. Sadly, [[Substack]] is a disappointment regarding privacy (see: [[Substack wants to scoop as much information as they can]]). I will migrate to a self-hosted solution as soon as I have time.  

For the time being, this is the link to join:

## When
Not everything needs to move incredibly fast. An article worth reading a month ago should also be worth reading in a year from now. I will start with a monthly newsletter, sharing everything from [[podcast]], to [[videos]], to [[articles]] or [[books]] I've read. 

Looking back, I can confidently say I am not good at keeping a newsletter going. Nor for [[Python for the Lab]], nor for this website. I completely lack consistency. One of the problems is not finding my audience yet.
