# Newsletter
## Why
We consume a lot of content both online and offline. We judge the content and decide which things are worth sharing with others and which ones are not. This is called curating content. I thought it would be nice to share what I came across that consider worth other's time. 

## How
I have been self-hosting newsletters for other websites, but I wanted this one to be as minimalistic as possible. Therefore, I opted for [[Substack]] just because it seemed dead simple to integrate. I am not sure if I'll keep them for the long run or not, but to get started was simple enough. 

## When
Not everything needs to move incredibly fast. An article worth reading a month ago should also be worth reading in a year from now. I will start with a monthly newsletter, sharing everything from [[podcast]], to [[videos]], to [[articles]] or [[books]] I've read.
