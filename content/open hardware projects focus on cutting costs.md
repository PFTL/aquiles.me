Many [[open hardware]] projects focus too much on the cheap aspect (e.g.: [@wijnen2014][@baden2015][@pearce2017][@pearce2020]) and this is a problem for establishing the value of a product. 

Most open-hardware projects when discussing costs, do not factor in the cost of development nor manufacturing. Given for granted the training it requires to get someone to do a proper 3D print, design electronics, or failed attempts. 

These costs are very often covered by institutions (for example, a grant that pays a Ph.D. salary). New digital manufacturing methods are only exacerbating the problem, because instead of having one company mass-producing a tool, there are hundreds or thousands of people printing the same tool at their work place. 

An [[open hardware business model]] should focus on the value the "open" delivers instead of the costs it helps cut because there is, in many cases, a very large chance that the true costs are not really compensated. 

Moreover, [[open hardware should not be a strategy to overcome licensing]] by researchers. The fact that someone made it open does not mean there wasn't an institution absorbing risks, paying salaries, etc.
