# NOW!
- Heading for my first [[bikepacking]] trip.

## On Hold
- I am reading about [[Brownian Diffusion]] in order to improve the methods for [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] and measuring the [[size of nanoparticles]]
- I am improving the design of the [[prototype]] of the first [[Dispertech]] device. So far it is very promising.
- I am roaming the idea of making [[video tutorials]] for [[Python for the Lab]]. I am developing the outline of the course. 
- I am reading [[Start with why]] by [[Simon Sinek]]
