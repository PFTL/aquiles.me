Women do most of the work that is unpaid[^1]. This is, cooking, cleaning the house, caring for children. Therefore, the statistics that show that women's health deteriorate at lower week-working-hours than men, is pointing towards the fact that women already work more hours *and* they also work for-pay somewhere else. This effect has consequences in many different metrics, industries, and countries. 

[[Work policies designed for the average]] will be biased towards men.
