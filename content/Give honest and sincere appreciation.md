Dale Carnegie, in [@carnegie2010], suggests that the only way of getting someone to do something is by making that person actually want it. Of course, there are many different ways of achieving the same. Wanting to do it not to get fired, for example, is a valid reason. However, he also cites examples of leaders such as Lincoln, that state that people want to feel appreciated, "**The desire for the feeling of importance**".

> This desire makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the latest cars, and talk about your brilliant children. 

This is somehow similar to the argument of [[Start with why - Simon Sinek]], in which brands lead us to believe we want something that goes beyond the product itself. 

The feeling of importance is what makes billionaires donate money or somehow contribute with things that do not make directly their personal fortunes.
