# My e-mail

**[hey@aquiles.me](mailto:hey@aquiles.me)**

My e-mail changes from time to time, but I tend to be backwards compatible. This means that the e-mail I used 10 years ago is still valid, just that I don't advertise it anymore. If you have my public key, feel free to encrypt the message and don't forget to share your key with me as well.
