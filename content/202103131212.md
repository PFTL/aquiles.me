[[AAV2 capsids]] can be used for drug delivery, but they suffer from aggregation at different stages of the production. This makes them unstable for medical applications. The paper of [@wright2005] studies several approaches to mitigate aggregation even after several freeze-thaw cycles.

One of the most important conclusions is that ionic strength of the medium plays a crucial role. The studies are fundamentally done with [[dynamic light scattering]] but this renders challenging studying the ratio of aggregates. 

Studying of viral aggregates could be performed by the [[Dispertech]] device, and is without doubts something interesting for [[VectorY]]
