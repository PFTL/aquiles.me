title: Transclusion
description: Transclusions involve embedding and linking content of different origins on the same visual landscape. A webpage could be composed using various sources, and be used as a source

Transclusion in the digital domain is the possibility of embedding and linking content in order to build a dialog between parts. For example, embedding a tweet, or a video, is a form of transclusion. However, I can't embed parts of a web page in order to compose a new one. 

In my mind, I can't think about transclussion without thinking about Cortázar's book: Último Round.

Maggie Appleton[^1] discusses transclusions in a very similar way to how [[Web Mentions and Comments|webmentions]] work. I wonder if she was aware of the standard when she wrote the note. She quickly identifies the caveats associated with embedding content of others, mainly of link rot, but also of moderation nightmares. 

Should transclusion  work both ways, embedding content and letting the source know that I did so? I find that [Hypotes.is](https://hypothes.is/) is building in that direction, adding notes and highlights (public, private, or shareable) directly on the website. It is missing, however, the version-control aspect of it. If the source changes, the notes become meaningless. 

The [[federated wiki]] is an early example of transclusion between websites that follow a standard. Pop-over links are also a visual way of transclusion. Is it possible to think about non-visual transclusion? 

Most challenges of transclusion are lifted if one considers private networks of knowledge (private but not individually own). For example, a knowledge network of a company, research group, etc. Sources are immediately vouched for, and content could be either public-facing or only internal.
