## Podcasts
- Mindscape: Justin Clarke-Doane on Mathematics, Morality, Objectivity, and Reality
    - Quite boring and long. Couldn't really get what the points they wanted to make were. Very basic insights on logic such as if a is b, and b is c, then a is c. Anyways. 
- The Documentary Podcast: The Saudis and the superpower. 
    - Discussion on the role of the US policies with Saudi Arabia (especially revolving around the killing of Khashoggi). Nothing will change, regardless of who is the president of the US and whatever they say
- 99% Invisible: Florence Nightingale Data Viz Pioneer
    - This episode is hosted by Tim Harford. Very nicely produced, with voice actors and a clear narrative. It is a discussion on how data started being communicated as figures instead of tables, and how they can be manipulated depending on each one's goals. Especially interesting, [[if a person is exposed to a figure for 500ms they'll be able to remember some features and draw conclusions]]. 
- Science Vs: Immune Boosting: Is it a bust? 
    - Short answer, yes. Except for doing some exercise (even a walk helps)
- Quilo de Ciencia: Ébola explicado. 
- Ted Radio Hour: Life Stages of the Brain.
    - One of the most interesting topics: there is a [[correlation between brain developement and family income]]. See [Kimberly Noble](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/kgn2106/)

## Papers
- Dysfunctional Consequences of Performance Measurements [@ridgway1956]. See: [[quantitative performance measurements produce undesired outputs]]
