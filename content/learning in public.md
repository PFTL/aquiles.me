# Learning in Public
I have always been a fan of [[working in public]] (also shortened as WIP[^1 ]). My [Github](https://www.github.com/aquilesC) is full with projects, including published [[papers]]. They document the evolution of a long process, and even though I don't think anyone is taking a look at them, they may become useful at some point in history. 

But, learning in public has also put me in contact with people already. Especially with [[code]]. I tend to share as I build, I don't wait to have a working *product*. This means that I can show what I do much quicker, and people can relate and suggest improvements at earlier stages. I have always developed [[open source]] code, mainly because I don't see an upside in closing it. Now that I am part of a business, I wonder if it is possible to convince others of the success of this approach.  

## Risks
I think that learning in public exposes oneself to the world in a very vulnerable state. We can make mistakes, and we can be criticized for them, especially if they happen in an ethical or political context more than in a technical one. Perhaps because my audience is limited, I can afford building things openly.
