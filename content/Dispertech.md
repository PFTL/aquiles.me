# Dispertech
At [Dispertech](https://www.dispertech.com) we want to empower researchers by unlocking the potential of [[extracelluar vesicle|extracelluar vesicles]] as biomarkers. We employ hollow optical fibers in combination with [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] to measure the size with unprecedented accuracy. 

## Our History
Dispertech is the brain child of [[Sanli Faez]]. He developed the technique while doing a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute, first, and later at Leiden University. I joined Sanli's lab in Utrecht University as a part-time postdoc in order to develop the business plan while also participating in [[UtrechtInc]], an incubator associated with the University. 

This project is what allows me to experience [[entrepreneurship]] and [[technology transfer]] from a first-hand perspective.
