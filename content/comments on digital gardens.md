# Comments on Digital Gardens
I believe that having the possibility of adding comments on a [[digital garden]] is the quickest way of collecting feedback from visitors. If someone wants to interact with me regarding anything that I've written, it should be a few key-strokes away and not based on an external platform. 

However, comments on a garden are attached to a given status of the note. I wonder what would the impact be of this dialog that may end up being disconnected between text and comments. Perhaps if contents would fade away with time it could be a good compromise. Or fade away (slowly) with the edits of the notes. 

I miss comments on other's digital gardens, because I feel there is a big barrier for connecting with them (sending a message through Twitter does not feel the best, and I think there's always a chance of messages getting lost.)
