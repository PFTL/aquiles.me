## Emerging patterns between notes
Once the garden is well kept, we will find that we have notes that irradiate links, and notes that attract links. For example, when I write literature notes I keep a central note out of which I link to each chapter or concept discussed within that specific book. These notes irradiate links, they are a way of starting a crawl. 

Other notes attract links, even if sometimes the note itself does not exist. When I research about topics, some common elements will emerge, some topics, some ideas. The notes on those central points become nodes with plenty of inbound links. In a way, there is a high chance that these central nodes could be thought as *categories* in different management systems. 

Visualizing the notes in a graph such as the one at the beginning can be very helpful to understand the relationship between notes, but it is not a requirement. It may appear that two very distinct categories share many notes.
