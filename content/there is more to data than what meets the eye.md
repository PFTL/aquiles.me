# There is More to Data than what Meets the Eye
When raising the concern about [[user privacy online]] and [[data collection]], one of the biggest challenges is replying to a comment such as:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="I%20don't%20Click%20on%20Newsletter%20Links%20Because%20I%20Know%20they%20Track%20me" data-author="@IndieHackers" cite="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-dont-click-on-newsletter-links-because-i-know-they-track-me-842c28e6f5">
But... what's the big deal? The "data" you're referring to is simply that you clicked on a link, that they sent you, because you signed up..... I don't get it.

And I believe that these reactions stem from poor communication, especially fueled by the bigger players around that strive at creating misconceptions. The most important thing is to understand [[what is a machine learning algorithm]] and roughly how it works. 

The problem with data collection is not necessarily the data itself, which may be innocent: what browser I use, what fonts I have installed, when did I click on a newsletter article, but what questions can be answered with that data. Maybe there is a correlation between the seemingly *innocent* data and your sexual orientation, or political views. 

From an algorithm perspective, it does not matter whether you explicitly state your political position. The correlation can be found using other's people data and extrapolated to the rest. The two examples of sexual orientation and political inclination are already a problem in today's world. There are countries in which homosexuality can be punished or is highly un-approved by society. In some places political dissent is forbidden. 

But let's not focus solely about "bad actors", repressive governments, etc. Imagine we can predict whether a woman is pregnant by looking at her chocolate consumption[^1]. It is reasonable to think that there will be a correlation between chocolate consumption and extended absence at work. If we were a recruiting agency [[Simple explanation of an optimization algorithm|optimizing]] for employee engagement, we wouldn't even need to know the gender of the candidates, we would check the chocolate consumption and [[bias]] ourselves towards men that can't get pregnant. 

The data sources are many, and they are for purchase (see: [[Commercially available private data and security services]]). Data is not going anywhere, it is being accumulated and aggregated without interruptions. The same data that today seems meaningless, tomorrow can be a predictor of behavior the political power of the time does not consider correct. 

Therefore, when I talk about [[user privacy online]], I am not only thinking about the consequences [[massive data collection]] already has today. I am also concerned about the consequences it will have in the future. We can't guarantee that the freedoms we have today will be the same tomorrow. 

There are some individual actions that can create [[a healthier internet]], such as acknowledging [[the power of web developers]]. However, the only path is to generate a collective consciousness of the problems that are arising, and understanding that [[the people who is part of the problem cannot be the solution]].
