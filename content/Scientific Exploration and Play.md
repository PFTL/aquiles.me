# Scientific Exploration and Play

In [[As We May Think - Vannevar Bush|As We May Think]] [@bush1945], Vannevar Bush argues that scientists must be free to pursue their own ideas. He wrote those words right after the war, when science could not afford but to focus on very specific efforts. He foresaw a context of scientific expansion and exploration that seems failed short looking in retrospect. 

In [@bhattacharya2020], the authors argue that it is only through scientific exploration and *play* that new ideas can be tested and taken to the latest consequences. However, the [[problems with citation-based metrics]] may skew the incentives of scientists in favor of work that already fits into a community and has a clear value instead of early idea exploration. 

In order to further extend their model, they developed a [[lifecycle of a sicentific idea]] to identify at which stage the problems arise and how to move the measuring stick in order to favor exploratory and play work.
