# About this Website

I realized that maintaining a blog requires a lot of effort, mostly because the expectations are very high. I can't publish half-baked articles, nor short notes. Moreover, a blog should construct a persona of myself. That is why I blog about Python on [Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com), and about more professional topics on [Aquicarattino](https://www.aquicarattino.com). 

However, sometimes I would like to write about how I achieved something that may be useful for myself or others. Still, it does not quite fit the content of my websites. I end up documenting scattered notes that never become public. Fortunately, I crossed [this article](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki) on how to build a [[digital garden]], which lead to a series of surprising discoveries. 

## This website is a digital garden
This website is meant to be a forever growing work in progress. Some of the notes you'll find here are incomplete or have mistakes. I am not ashamed of them. They are a way of learning. If you think you spotted something you don't agree with, or that is simply wrong, just [reach out to me](https://www.twitter.com/aquicarattino). 

### No indexes, no vanity tracking
The idea of braking with the mold of a *blog* is that there are no indexes, no categories, no chronological ordering. The only way to navigate this website is by following [[links]]. Some are orange, some are blue. The orange ones are internal links; the blue brings you to other websites. 

On the other hand, each page has a list of the pages linking to it. And there shouldn't be dead links. If I make a link to an empty page, it will be created automatically. This allows us to have nodes between pages, and the tree becomes apparent even without explicit content. 

I do not track which pages are views the most. It is not the point of the website. I don't want metrics to dictate what I write about. If you do find something interesting, you are always free to share or link back to it. Some ideas may get written down in the form of an article. I haven't decided yet if that will appear on this website or somewhere else.
