@Fo2020 claims that they can measure [[size of nanoparticles]] with an accuracy of just 8nm per particle. However, they claim that their tracks are not long enough to measure diameter in 41% of the cases. I wonder if in the remaining 59% of the analyzed tracks can be good enough as to claim such a small error. They have relied too much on Trackpy, which makes me wonder whether they have enough understanding of the inner workings. 

Also, they develop a method of time-weighted histogram building in order to prioritize particles with a longer track. However, there is no mention to the [[Walker algorithm]], which makes me believe the group is not up-to-date regarding [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] techniques.
