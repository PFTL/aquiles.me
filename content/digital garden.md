# Digital Gardening
When I crossed the idea of a digital garden, I first thought it was not for me. But then I saw it again on a website I seem I can't find back. The principle is simple: just write down [[notes]] with [[links]] whenever an idea crosses your mind. This idea may be triggered by a [[podcast]], an [[article]], or any other interaction you have in your day.

With enough time, the notes you take will start to form a forest of interconnected thoughts. This, in itself, sounded to me like a great idea. Each note is a seed, that has to potential to develop branches. At the same time, each branch is a seed itself, and therefore the garden becomes a graph. But, gardening sounds better than graphing. 

There is another aspect to the gardening itself, which is the [[learning in public]] aspect. If you make your notes public to the world, you create the possibility of engaging with like minded individuals in your own thought process. For what I could gather, this is somehow what [[roam research]] is trying to achieve, by creating connections between the notes of different people. 

I am a bit more modest, and I am very happy about [[how i built this website]] from scratch. Very low tech requirements. My notes are offline in [[markdown]], using [[Obsidian]] or [[Zettlr]] as the note-taking interface. They are backed up, synchronized, and version controlled on [[Github]]. The website itself is automatically deployed on [[netlify]]. 

## Gardening is not just collecting
Something very important to point out is that to properly grow a garden, you must not only collect notes. Gardening requires [[actively creating knowledge]] on every note taking action. This means that copy/pasting is highly discouraged, while re-writing on your own terms is highly encouraged. I like this approach, because it develops my [[sense of ownership]] on the content I'm releasing. 

## Gardens for Inspiration
I have modeled this website on the following ones:
- [Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) by [[Andy Matuschak]]
- [Mental Nodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/) by [[Anne-Laure le Cunff]]
Design ideas:
- [Notes](https://notes.aravindballa.com/) by [[Aravind Balla]]
- [Brain](https://aengusmcmillin.com/brain) by [[Aengus McMillin]]

Now, to be honest, I am highly disappointed at the fact that Mental Nodes is barely updated. Despite the tutorials and articles claiming that [[learning in public]] is important, that public garden is quite abandoned. The few people that mentioned they are gardening normally produce around 4 or 5 notes and then they stop. 

At the time of writing (30-July-2020), one month after started with this project, I am totaling over 80 notes, without a plan to stop writing. 

[[What happens when notes become long]]?
