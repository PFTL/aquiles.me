# Digital Gardening
When I crossed the idea of a digital garden, I first thought it was not for me. But then I saw it again on a website I seem I can't find back. The principle is simple: just write down [[notes]] with [[links]] whenever an idea crosses your mind. This idea may be triggered by a [[podcast]], an [[article]], or any other interaction you have in your day.

With enough time, the notes you take will start to form a forest of interconnected thoughts. This, in itself, seems sounded to me like a great idea. Each note is a seed, that has to potential to develop branches. At the same time, each branch is a seed itself, and therefore the garden becomes a graph. But, gardening sounds better than graphing. 

There is another aspect to the gardening itself, which is the [[learning in public]] aspect. If you make your notes public to the world, you create the possibility of engaging with like minded individuals in your own thought process. For what I could gather, this is somehow what [[roam]] is trying to achieve, by creating connections between the notes of different people. 

I am a bit more modest, and I am very happy about [[how i built this website]] from scratch. Very low tech requirements. My notes are offline in [[markdown]], using [[Obsidian]] or [[Zettlr]] as the note-taking interface. They are backed up, synchronized, and version controlled on [[Github]]. The website itself is automatically deployed on [[netlify]].
