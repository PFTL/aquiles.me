# Lower the Barrier to Writing
One of my [[2020 goals]] is to write and create more. That is one of the reasons I decided to create a [[digital garden]], developed my own scripts to build the website (see [[how i built this website]]), and tuned them over time with one goal in mind: **lower to barrier to writing** as much as I could. 

## The Why
Another of my goals is to [[ask why]] more often (or in a more mindful way). I want to write more because I want to communicate more about the things I think. I see a lot of problems that stem from a lack of understanding. I see people with huge followings that just didn't get it right. And this frustrates me. I want to slowly make a [[healthier internet]]. I want to discuss about [[gender diversity academia]] even though I am an outsider (or especially because I am one). 

I know I want to **write more, and to make my writing public** as soon as possible. 

## My Approach
### Writing First
The approach I took started, first, by forcing myself to write every day, in order to develop [[my writing habits]]. It took me a while to understand what process made me happy. Tried Roam, Evernote, until I finally settled for plain markdown using mostly Obsidian. 

The advantage of having an offline tool is that I can write without distractions. I can start even before opening the browser and its infinite tabs of unfinished things to read, reply, or catch up with. 

### Publishing Second
Once I started having a small body of work, of interlinked notes, it was time to make them publicly available. There are many different ways of achieving the same. One is to use Github pages, which will automatically compile the notes with Jekyll. Gatsby seems to be what most people use these days. I went for building my own (see: [[how i built this website]]). 

I make no distinction between notes and articles. Some notes are just longer (see [[What happens when notes become long]]). I know some people read them because they have commented about them, but I do not keep stats. [[I don't track the visitors]] of this website, not only for [[user privacy online]], but also to be completely free to write whatever I want, without self-biasing me to pursue a bigger viewership. 

### Sharing Third
I haven't reached the step of actively sharing my content. I am looking into [[webmentions]] in order to link with other content creators out there. I do think that at some point I will have some articles that are more than stubs and that can be spread. I am looking at building a [[newsletter]], or at least adding some [[rss feed]] so people can be up-to date. However, I am afraid that whatever I do in this third step will have a net negative impact in my goal of having a low barrier.
