# A New Way of Blogging
I have been trying to keep up with blogs for way too long. Around 15 years ago, I had a blog for science articles, a blog for Linux, a blog about [[Buenos Aires]], and a personal blog. I was young, had a lot of time in my hands, and above all I was mostly learning and not producing, so I could easily channel energy into generating some content. But, as with most blogs, over the years they were abandoned. 

I tried several times to revamp them, to find motivation, but in the end I always failed to be consistent at writing, and the shame of not being consistent was too large. Deep down I know I had to [[lower the barrier to writing]]. One day I crossed the idea of a [[digital garden]] and jumped right onto it. While I still believe that [[this website is not a blog]] (at least not in the traditional way of blogging), most of what I want to achieve is the same I wanted while blogging in the past, but with a different approach. 

## Breaking the Chronological Order

And the damn reverse chronology bias â€” <em>once called into creation, it hungers eternally</em> â€” sought its next victim. Myspace. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Pinterest, of all things.

A common feature of blogging was the idea of having articles displayed in *chronological order*. This may work for someone who does a real periodic log, but not for the majority of the people who like writing about what they know, about what they learn. Even technical articles about a programming language need to be updated once in a while, or follow up content must be properly linked.

The first thing I did when building this website (see: [[how i built this website]]) was to remove any form of ordering, and focused solely on the navigation aspects. If someone reaches a page I wrote (either because I or someone else shared it, or because Google sent them), I want to give them the possibility to keep exploring the different aspects of what I think and write. That is why I also focused on making backlinks very visible, and there is a color distinction between internal links and external links. 

## Digital Garden or New Type of Blog
I find very compelling the idea of a [[digital garden]], and of [[learning in public]]. However, I also think this approach is not for everybody, and not all people can afford to be truly transparent about what they think when their business is at stake. However, I do think that there is an **approach in between a garden and a blog** that can be of great value to a lot of people.

For my personal garden (note: your requirements and needs might be different!) I set out to build something that would focus on stock over flow, be a blogging product without a publish button and create a space for collecting the dots.

The idea of blogging without a "Publish Button" can [[lower the barrier to writing]] and to releasing content. The biggest questions every aspiring blogger must ask themselves is [[why you do it]]. 

## Personal Blogs
If you are writing a **personal blog**, you must define what **personal** means to you. Some people like writing about their holidays and share photos. Some like to write about their job, and give advise on how to navigate the modern workforce technocracy. Sometimes you don't yet know what you want to write about. It can also very well be that you just want to **write about anything**. 

The biggest obstacle is that if you ask around, the standard answer is:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Single-focus%20or%20multiple%20topics%20for%20a%20personal%20blog%3F" data-author="@IndieHackers" cite="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/single-focus-or-multiple-topics-for-a-personal-blog-bd605af5fe">Starting with one topic will be easier to grow an audience. That doesn't limit you from expanding in the future, but it's important that you start with one to build a solid audience and establish trust. Once that trust is established, people will follow you in other topics as well :)

</blockquote>
<script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>

And this may not fit everyone. Creativity, especially on tasks we are not familiar with, such as writing, is not a linear process. Narrowing the scope too much can only hinder our progress. However, a bunch of notes is hard to navigate for an outsider, regardless of how curated your interface is. Some thoughts contradict each other, some are incomplete. That is one of the beauties of a [[digital garden]], but is not compelling for people seeking other kinds of content. 

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Building%20a%20digital%20garden" data-author="@tomcritchlow" cite="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/">The distinction will come down to how you blog - some people blog in much the same way. For me however blogging is mostly <em>performative thinking</em> and less captainâ€™s log. So I am looking for a space to nurture, edit in real time and evolve my thinking.

Therefore, there is an intermediate approach, in which you can still curate your content in the same way you create blog posts, but lower the barrier to publishing. As Tom Critchlow puts it, you an find a way of **less performative blogging**. You may start with notes (either public or not) that grow into an article. However, once you acknowledge that whatever you publish can be edited, expanded, deleted, you will also realize that the content you generate can mutate. It is still a blog, but it is also a garden. You can (and are encourage to) revisit the notes, build new links, update them. 

I do think this approach is particularly interesting for personal blogs because the personality we show online can change over time. We can be very vocal about some subjects at one moment in our lives. After learning more on some of those topics, or just maturing, our views can change. Once we embrace the flowing spirit of thoughts and writings, there won't be any need to keep a chronological log of what we were thinking about at every moment of our lives if we don't want to.

The most important objective of a personal blog, I believe, is to **be out there**. Let like-minded people connect to what you think. Help your past-self that is most likely going to be very similar to another human being out there. Single-topic blogs reflect only one aspect of your life, and miss the richness of your experiences. I am a [[Python]] developer, but I also like to think about [[privacy]] and [[Technology Transfer]]. So, why limit myself?

## The Marketing Blog
Not all blogs can be addressed as gardens. I think that if you are building a blog as a **marketing strategy**, you must be consequent with that approach. A marketing blog is the utmost form of performative blogging. You need to generate content that serves the audience of *your* product. It will help with ranking better on Google, and also to create more empathy towards your services. You are not trying to understand who your audience is, you are trying to captivate whoever you defined as audience already.

But it also means you must approach blogging as a job, and not as a tool for enjoyment. You must lay out a plan, what keywords must be included, how often and, more importantly, how to upsell to your guests. At some point you want to transform a reader to a customer. 

I think [nesslabs](https://nesslabs.com/) and its associated "garden" [mentalnodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/) are a good example of how to build an entire content scheme that delivers enough value but not all of it. That is how you are lured into becoming a payed member of a closed community. It requires a lot of time and effort, and more importantly a lot of consistency, to achieve what [[Anne-Laure le Cunff]] achieved. Her blog is not selling a product, but the idea that if you are interested in the content, there is value in connecting with other readers. Do you think it is by chance that the article have no comments? 

There are many other examples around, but nesslabs is the first I see born and grow and flourish and become a successful business. However, marketing blogs require new content to be released in order to keep the audience and the algorithms happy. Improving on old notes has a relatively low impact as a marketing strategy. As a customer, I wouldn't like updates every two days about a couple of lines that you improved in your writing of an article that I already saw two months ago. 

## The Personal Marketing Blog
Finally, there is one last type of website to discuss: the hybrid between marketing and personal. What happens when you are trying to sell yourself. [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com) openly talks about this. He is a consultant, and you may decide to hire him based on what you read on his website.
