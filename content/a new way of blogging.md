# A New Way of Blogging
I define a *blog* as any website that delivers value through written content from well defined authors. This means that Wikipedia is not a blog because its authors are not at the center, but [[newspapers are blogs]], as well as many personal websites. Therefore, discussing *how to blog* must consider the type of website that is behind. 

For *personal websites*, such as this one, I do believe that the first objective one must have is to [[lower the barrier to writing]]. I focused for too long on how to manage content that forgot the most important aspect of having a personal website: push content out often as I wanted, with as low friction as possible. In other words, I also wanted to [[lower the barrier to publishing]]. 

Therefore, the idea of approaching a blog as a public [[digital garden]], seemed a perfect fit for what I wanted to achieve. But gardening is only half the aspect of blogging, it relates to the writing, the content creation and curation but not to the publishing. In order to make the writings public, there must be an agreement between me and the readers. I am trying to summarize that agreement as [[digital garden tos]] (terms of service). 

Once we decide that we can push content online at different levels of certainty, there is a very little barrier for *publishing*. It is very helpful if we make the level of certainty explicit whenever possible, such as by marking each note with an [[epistemic status]]. 

Another aspect of this way of blogging is [[breaking the chronological order]]. Many of the things I want to write about are not explicitly time-dependent. If I write about a book I read, the person finding my thoughts would probably not care whether I wrote the notes one day or one year before. This timeless aspect is poorly reflected with time-based logs. 

## Digital Garden or New Type of Blog
I find very compelling the idea of a [[digital garden]], and of [[learning in public]]. However, I also think this approach is not for everybody, and not all people can afford to be truly transparent about what they think when their business is at stake. However, I do think that there is an **approach in between a garden and a blog** that can be of great value to a lot of people.

For my personal garden (note: your requirements and needs might be different!) I set out to build something that would focus on stock over flow, be a blogging product without a publish button and create a space for collecting the dots.

The idea of blogging without a "Publish Button" can [[lower the barrier to writing]] and to releasing content. The biggest questions every aspiring blogger must ask themselves is [[why you do it]]. 

## Personal Blogs
If you are writing a **personal blog**, you must define what **personal** means to you. Some people like writing about their holidays and share photos. Some like to write about their job, and give advise on how to navigate the modern workforce technocracy. Sometimes you don't yet know what you want to write about. It can also very well be that you just want to **write about anything**. 

The biggest obstacle is that if you ask around, the standard answer is:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Single-focus%20or%20multiple%20topics%20for%20a%20personal%20blog%3F" data-author="@IndieHackers" cite="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/single-focus-or-multiple-topics-for-a-personal-blog-bd605af5fe">Starting with one topic will be easier to grow an audience. That doesn't limit you from expanding in the future, but it's important that you start with one to build a solid audience and establish trust. Once that trust is established, people will follow you in other topics as well :)

</blockquote>
<script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>

And this may not fit everyone. Creativity, especially on tasks we are not familiar with, such as writing, is not a linear process. Narrowing the scope too much can only hinder our progress. However, a bunch of notes is hard to navigate for an outsider, regardless of how curated your interface is. Some thoughts contradict each other, some are incomplete. That is one of the beauties of a [[digital garden]], but is not compelling for people seeking other kinds of content. 

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Building%20a%20digital%20garden" data-author="@tomcritchlow" cite="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/">The distinction will come down to how you blog - some people blog in much the same way. For me however blogging is mostly <em>performative thinking</em> and less captainâ€™s log. So I am looking for a space to nurture, edit in real time and evolve my thinking.

Therefore, there is an intermediate approach, in which you can still curate your content in the same way you create blog posts, but lower the barrier to publishing. As Tom Critchlow puts it, you an find a way of **[[less performative blogging]]**. You may start with notes (either public or not) that grow into an article. However, once you acknowledge that whatever you publish can be edited, expanded, deleted, you will also realize that the content you generate can mutate. It is still a blog, but it is also a garden. You can (and are encourage to) revisit the notes, build new links, update them. 

I do think this approach is particularly interesting for personal blogs because the personality we show online can change over time. We can be very vocal about some subjects at one moment in our lives. After learning more on some of those topics, or just maturing, our views can change. Once we embrace the flowing spirit of thoughts and writings, there won't be any need to keep a chronological log of what we were thinking about at every moment of our lives if we don't want to.

The most important objective of a personal blog, I believe, is to **be out there**. Let like-minded people connect to what you think. Help your past-self that is most likely going to be very similar to another human being out there. Single-topic blogs reflect only one aspect of your life, and miss the richness of your experiences. I am a [[Python]] developer, but I also like to think about [[privacy]] and [[Technology Transfer]]. So, why limit myself?

## The Marketing Blog
Not all blogs can be addressed as gardens. I think that if you are building a blog as a **marketing strategy**, you must be consequent with that approach. A marketing blog is the utmost form of [[performative blogging]]. You need to generate content that serves the audience of *your* product. It will help with ranking better on Google, and also to create more empathy towards your services. You are not trying to understand who your audience is, you are trying to captivate whoever you defined as audience already.

But it also means you must approach blogging as a job, and not as a tool for enjoyment. You must lay out a plan, define what keywords must be included, how often are articles going to be published and, more importantly, how to upsell to your guests. At some point you want to transform a reader to a customer. Doing proper blogging as a side-project is almost impossible. Writing takes too much time to actually offset its costs. 

It may also be that a blog is not a just a content-creation engine for another product, but **the blog itself is the product**. I think [nesslabs](https://nesslabs.com/) and its associated "garden" [mentalnodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/) are a good example of how to build an entire content scheme that delivers enough value but not all of it. That is how you are lured into becoming a payed member of a closed community. It requires a lot of time and effort, and more importantly a lot of consistency, to achieve what [[Anne-Laure le Cunff]] achieved. Her blog is not about selling a concrete product, but the idea that if you are interested in the content, there is value in connecting with other readers. Do you think it is by chance that the article have no comments? 

There are many other examples around, but nesslabs is the first one I get to see born, grow, and flourish to become a successful business. However, marketing blogs require new content to be released in order to keep the audience and the algorithms happy. Improving on old notes has a relatively low impact as a marketing strategy. As a customer, I wouldn't like updates every two days about a couple of lines that you improved in your writing of an article that I already saw two months ago. 

## The Personal Marketing Blog
Finally, there is one last type of website to discuss: the hybrid between marketing and personal. What happens when you are trying to sell yourself. [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com) openly talks about this. He is a consultant, and you may decide to hire him based on what you read on his website. This quote is very descriptive of what *developers* perceive generating content must be:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Learn%20In%20Public%3A%20The%20fastest%20way%20to%20learn" data-author="" cite="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">
At some point people will start asking you for help because of all the stuff you put out. 80% of developers are "dark", they dont write or speak or participate in public tech discourse. But you do. You must be an expert, right? Don't tell them you aren't. Answer best as you can, and when you're stuck or wrong pass it up to your mentors.

In that case you have to be mindful about what you post online and how you present yourself. I have seen people separating between blog and notes. [Andy Matuschack](notes.andymatuschak.org/) does this by having his notes on a separate subdomain. Once the notes evolve to a stable state he publishes them in the form of articles.  

As I discussed above, making the notes public is not for everyone, and not all notes can be shared. In any case, the approach of harvesting, curating, and linking knowledge applies.
