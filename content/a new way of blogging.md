# A New Way of Blogging
I define a *blog* as any website that delivers value through written content from well defined authors. This means that Wikipedia is not a blog because its authors are not at the center, but [[newspapers are blogs]], as well as many personal websites. Therefore, discussing *how to blog* must consider the type of website that is behind. 

For *personal websites*, such as this one, I do believe that the first objective one must have is to [[lower the barrier to writing]]. I focused for too long on how to manage content that forgot the most important aspect of having a personal website: push content out as often as I wanted, with as low friction as possible. In other words, I also wanted to [[lower the barrier to publishing]]. 

The idea of approaching a blog as a public [[digital garden]], seemed like a perfect fit for what I wanted to achieve. But gardening is only half the aspect of blogging, it relates to the writing, the content creation and curation but not to the publishing. In order to make the writings public, there must be an agreement between me and the readers. I am trying to summarize that agreement as [[digital garden tos]] (terms of service). 

## Digital Garden or New Type of Blog
Even though I find very compelling the idea of a [[digital garden]] as a way of [[thinking better]], a garden is associated with the process of note-taking. This is great to get started, because I could focus on very short creative sprints. However, why would I limit myself to short notes instead of going for full-fledged articles and reflection? 

When I asked myself [[what happens when notes become long]], I realized I didn't need to push them to a different corner of the internet. I could let them flourish where I feel confident. That's how this hybrid idea between both a garden and a blog came to me. I've seen people separating their notes from their articles, but I want to experiment having them intertwined. 

## Curation at the center of creation or breaking the chronological order
Another idea normally associated to blogging is to keep the articles in a chronological order. This may be rooted into the origins of blogs, and the ideas permeated our social media channels and the way we interact with content online.

And the damn reverse chronology bias — <em>once called into creation, it hungers eternally</em> — sought its next victim. Myspace. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Pinterest, of all things.

But it does not mean that all we do must be organized in the form of a log. If we are not a newspaper dealing with the most pressing issues of the day, we are free to [[breaking the chronological order]]. Ideas pop up at different stages, we create links between thoughts perhaps much after we have developed the original concepts. And the web is perfectly capable of dealing with these forms of organizing the contents.

The distinction will come down to how you blog - some people blog in much the same way. For me however blogging is mostly <em>performative thinking</em> and less captain’s log. So I am looking for a space to nurture, edit in real time and evolve my thinking.

I believe that for websites such as this one, curation must be at the center of creation. Each link to another note is carefully decided. The home page shows some links to things I've written and am proud of, or half-baked ideas that I want to get out to discuss with people to understand them better. 

## Without a publish button, then what? 
I work with plain files. I write offline, and when the notes are saved they end up on the website. There is no 'private draft', no preview opportunity, no schedule for later. This is tightly related to the notion of [[learning in public]]. If you pay close attention, you could see how half-written articles progress to a full-fledged, hacker-news frontpage-worthy post. 

However, I also believe this approach is not for everybody, and not all people can afford to be truly transparent about what they think when their business is at stake. Whenever I am about to save an article I must filter its contents. It does not mean I don't have my own biases, but somehow I must force myself to overcome them. I force myself to *think politely* instead of sanguinously. It is both good and bad, but I think it contributes towards making [[a healthier internet]]. 

The idea of blogging without a "Publish Button" can both [[lower the barrier to writing]] and [[lower the barrier to publishing]]. It also means that articles and notes are not static, perennial, they can (and must) be periodically looked after, updated, improved, or even removed. That's why I've added the publish date, last edit date, and the total number of edits on each one of them (see: [[how do I define number of edits on notes]]). 

There are no: "related articles" algorithmically created. I am not trying to [[Simple explanation of an optimization algorithm|optimize]] the time a user spends on my website. I am trying to optimize, though, the value someone can extract from these pages. The idea of having so many inter-connected notes is that each reader can follow their own path. You may start on this article and quickly diverge and start reading about *Democracy and Algorithms* (I intentionally don't put a link here, but there is a path of less than 4 clicks up to that note). 

## Where to next
What I explored above is the path I've followed to achieve my goals. Mostly, writing more, publishing content online more often. I've managed to lower the friction a lot and I am happy with [[how i built this website]]. However, I understand that not everything what I believe and do can be extrapolated to other cases. See, for example:
