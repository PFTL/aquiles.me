# A New Way of Blogging
I have been trying to keep up with blogs for way too long. Around 15 years ago, I had a blog for science articles, a blog for Linux, a blog about [[Buenos Aires]], and a personal blog. I was young, had a lot of time in my hands, and above all I was mostly learning and not producing, so I could easily channel energy into generating some content. But, as with most blogs, over the years they were abandoned. 

I tried several times to revamp them, to find motivation, but in the end I always failed to be consistent at writing, and the shame of not being consistent was too large. Deep down I know I had to [[lower the barrier to writing]]. One day I crossed the idea of a [[digital garden]] and jumped right onto it. While I still believe that [[this website is not a blog]] (at least not in the traditional way of blogging), most of what I want to achieve is the same I wanted while blogging in the past, but with a different approach. 

## Breaking the Chronological Order

And the damn reverse chronology bias — <em>once called into creation, it hungers eternally</em> — sought its next victim. Myspace. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Pinterest, of all things.

A custom feature of blogging was the idea of having articles displayed in Chronological order. This may work for someone who does a real periodic log, but not for the majority of the people who like writing about what they know, about what they learn. Even technical articles about a programming language need to be updated once in a while, or follow up content must be properly linked. 

The first thing I did when building this website (see: [[how i built this website]]) was to remove any form of ordering, and focused solely on the navigation aspects. If someone reaches a page I wrote (either because I or someone else shared it, or because Google sent them), I want to give them the possibility to keep exploring the different aspects of what I think and write. That is why I also focused on making backlinks very visible, and I also create a color distinction between internal links and external links. 

## Digital Garden or New Type of Blog
I find very compelling the idea of a [[digital garden]], and of [[learning in public]]. However, I also think this approach is not for everybody, and not all can afford to be truly transparent about what they think when their business is at stake. However, I do think that there is an **in between approach** between a garden and a blog that can be of great value to a lot of people.

For my personal garden (note: your requirements and needs might be different!) I set out to build something that would focus on stock over flow, be a blogging product without a publish button and create a space for collecting the dots.

The idea of blogging without a "Publish Button" can [[lower the barrier to writing]] and to releasing content.
