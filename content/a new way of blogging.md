# A New Way of Blogging
I have been trying to keep up with blogs for way too long. Around 15 years ago, I had a blog for science articles, a blog for Linux, a blog about [[Buenos Aires]], and a personal blog. I was young, had a lot of time in my hands, and above all I was mostly learning and not producing, so I could easily channel energy into generating some content. But, as with most blogs, over the years they were abandoned. 

I tried several times to revamp them, to find motivation, but in the end I always failed to be consistent at writing, and the shame of not being consistent was too large. Deep down I know I had to [[lower the barrier to writing]]. One day I crossed the idea of a [[digital garden]] and jumped right onto it. While I still believe that [[this website is not a blog]] (at least not in the traditional way of blogging), most of what I want to achieve is the same I wanted while blogging in the past, but with a different approach. 

## Breaking the Chronological Order

And the damn reverse chronology bias — <em>once called into creation, it hungers eternally</em> — sought its next victim. Myspace. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Pinterest, of all things.
