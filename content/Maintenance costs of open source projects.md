# Maintenance costs of open source projects
Adding users to software projects has a marginal cost. This means that having 10 users is likely going to cost a developer the same amount of money than having 100 users. Particularly for [[open source]] software this means that if a project *explodes* and gathers thousands of users around it overnight, the developers will not incur in large expenses (or in any at all). 

However, there is another side, associated with the *maintenance costs*. [[Development costs of open source software]] may be offset by personal gain, but keeping a project alive has little reward as to make it for free[^1]. After a project is released, it is hard to know what its chances of long-term success are going to be. Here, defining success as continuous engagement and development. 

[[Scientific open source]] projects are a clear example of what happens when incentives are removed. Releasing code is highly rewarded, but maintaining it is completely neglected by the community. After you release a package, there is no way you can justify allocating time for it unless it is tied to your own personal and career interests.
