# Specialty parts suppliers for open-hardware tools

[@pearce2017] Suggests that a possible business model for [[open hardware]] products is to provide specialty parts and tools. For example, even if a project is open hardware it may still require a crystal which is hard to grow, or parts in a material hard to source. 

This can also be extended to a service, in which a company can provide custom designs to fit into the open-hardware tools. 

When [@pearce2017] discusses this approach, however, I think he has no clarity regarding what an open-hardware tool can do, and what it actually means to build complex machines. What he inadvertely proposes is that open-hardware businesses can make a living of crucial, non-open parts.
