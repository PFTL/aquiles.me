# Is Github contradictory of open source values? 

When developing [[Open source]], one of the core values used to be the independence from the tools used, especially when those tools are proprietary. An example can be the use of ``gcc`` instead of an Intel compiler. 

However, [[Nadia Eghbal]] argues[^1] that the convenience of easy-to-use tools such as Github outweights the political reasons behind open source. That is why so many projects, including some very big, such as Python, moved to Github. 

The question that remains is, therefore, what are the [[open source values]]? Do they change over time?
