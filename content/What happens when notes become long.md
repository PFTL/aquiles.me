Sometimes [[notes]] become long enough to be considered [[articles]] in their own right. In principle, I would like those pieces to be published on [[aquicarattino.com]], but it is so much simpler to keep them in here that I am not sure how to proceed.

Following with the metaphor of a garden, I think it is fair to ask what to do when sprouts become a tree.
