# This Website is Not a Blog
I realized that *blogging* is a very time consuming task because it puts a lot of pressure on the person writing. One of the problems I faced was that I wanted articles to be complete, self-contained. That they portray the best of me. [[Python for the Lab]] is a good example of it. Articles are full tutorials, and normally people like them. However, writing each article takes me a lot of time, in the order of weeks sometimes, or a lot of hours during weekends. 

At the same time, I was writing much more than what I was making public. I was also trying to document processes, and was taking notes on many different things. Some of those notes became articles, some never saw the light. I crossed the idea of a [[digital garden]] through [Ness Labs](https://www.nesslabs.com), and it felt like entering to a rabbit hole. I found out fantastic examples on how people make their notes public. Particularly, [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) seems quite active in the field. 

## The Honesty Moment
When I was going through those websites, I didn't feel at ease. This people spend a gigantic amount of hours writing and publishing. I also have a life, you know? It felt like I had to do more than what I was currently doing, and that anxiety is always an early indicator that there is something wrong with your way of thinking. 

It took some time, but I realized there was something I liked about what I was seeing. Publishing online should not be exclusive for finished, self-contained work. Also, one should not be limited to only one aspect of their lives. I have many [[hobbies]], some without an overlap to each other. I have also a professional image to maintain, I am "the [[Python]] guy" in a lot of contexts. 

Therefore, a hyper-linked website, in which there is no index seemed the best approach. Random notes, short (or long), articles, that mutate over time while I revisit them. The me who writes today about [[Technology Transfer]] will not feel the same way in two years.
