# Things I Want to Do
- [ ] Change the link design of the website. Instead of using colors, use different types of underlining. It will make the content MUCH easier to read since it is more consistent than jumping from orange to indigo to black.
- [ ] Consider adding some form of syndication such as [[rss feed]] for some of the notes, when they become long (see [[What happens when notes become long]]). Perhaps by adding a tag in the frontmatter?
- [ ] Explore the idea of building [blogchains](mcritchlow.com/2019/07/17/blogchains/):

A blogchain is longform by other means. Containerized longform if you like. A themed blog-within-a-blog, built as a series of short, ideally fixed-length posts (weâ€™re trying to standardize on 300 words as one container size).
