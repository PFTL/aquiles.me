# Finding a Problem to Solve
A common framework to plan and evaluate ideas for companies is to analyze them through a [[problem-solution cycle]]. Therefore, the best idea is to start by looking into problems that are worth solving. There are many successful companies that started by solving a very specific problem someone experienced. 

For example, Ring[^1] is a company that builds electronic doorbells. It all started when its founder, [[Jamie Siminoff]] realized that while working in his garage he could not listen if someone was ringing at his door. He built a small prototype and realized that others also had the same problem. More importantly, he later found that other problems that can be solved with his product. 

The example of Ring showcases a perfect example of how the problem-solution-iteration cycle works in practice. However, consumer products solve problems very different from what scientists solve daily in their labs.
