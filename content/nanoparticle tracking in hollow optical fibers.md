# Nanoparticle Tracking in Hollow Optical Fibers
![Schematic of the technology of Dispertech](/nanoCET.png)

At [[Dispertech]] we are building on the ideas of the image in order to go beyond the [[limitations of nanoparticle tracking analysis]] by increasing the time particles can be tracked, at the same time than we lower the background signal. This has a twofold benefit. First, it increases the accuracy when calculating the size by studying the [[brownian diffusion]] of the particles. The longer the traces, the best fit to the data. This is also the argument behind the [[Walker algorithm]] for calculating size-distributions. 

The other benefit is that by having a lower background signal, we can observe smaller particles. We have a low background because light is guided through the fiber and, in principle, the only light that is able to escape is the signal scattered out by the particles. This is not completely accurate, since there is always some light being transmitted through the [[cladding mode]] of the fiber.
