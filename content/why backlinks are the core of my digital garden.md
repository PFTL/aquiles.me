# Why Backlinks are the Core of my Digital Garden
When [[how i built this website|building this website]] I made a case about adding backlinks, also known as bidirectional links. At the moment, they were just a way to [[lower the barrier to writing]] because I could write one article, add a "tag", or a "category", and those pages would be automatically created. It generated a fluid idea of a taxonomy with an incredibly low barrier to just start writing. 

After a while, a realized that [[the power of bidirectional links]] lies much beyond a pure pragmatic result. In this [[digital garden]], backlinks allow me (and any other visitor) to traverse the graph of notes regardless of where they started, and regardless of the order in which I write the notes. Sometimes I create links to empty notes as a possible reminder to think about it. Sometimes those empty notes work as a central node to group thoughts beyond my original plans. 

Backlinks feel like a way of pinging myself. If make a link from this page to another one, I know I will find this article back when going through a different chain of thoughts. That feeling is both powerful and inspiring. It is a ping that does not require nor immediate action, nor any form of commitment. I may get back to it, or not. But it is there, both for me and for others to see. 

The following step is [[implementing webmentions]], which would enable to dynamically create [[backlinks across domains]]. In this way, not only my internal links, but also my external links become bidirectional ways of communication.
