# Substack
Substack added the possibility of discovering newsletters by giving them access to your Twitter account. However, they require too many privileges, including access to protected tweets, your timeline, your lists, etc. I find this a complete violation of my [[privacy]] and even worse, the privacy of others whom I follow on Twitter. Substack let me down massively, I tried to reach out to no avail. 

I went to read on their privacy policy and found that they are considering selling out our data, and our users data. This is completely un-acceptable for a service that is supposed to have a business model other than that of Facebook.
