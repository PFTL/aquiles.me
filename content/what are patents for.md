# What are Patents for
Before I started building [[Dispertech]], a project of [[technology transfer]], I regarded [[patents]] as a roadblock to innovation. An example was the patent on 3D printing, which halted further development of the associated techniques. A monopolistic situation raised prices and prevented printers from reaching the consumer market until patents expired:

For example, when the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing process patent expired in 2009, prices for FDM printers dropped from over $10,000 to less than $1,000, and a new crop of consumer-friendly 3D printer manufacturers, like MakerBot and Ultimaker, paved the way for accessible 3D printing.

On the other hand, patents are open. Anyone can see them, learn from them, and in principle build on them. It is likely that industrial processes regarded as *trade secrets* are not patented. The laser in Philips' last DVD/CD-writer needed to be precisely aligned for it to work. The tool they developed was not patented and was jealously guarded in their own manufacturing plant. Without this tool, even if you copied the design of the drives, you would have never managed to replicate the product, and without a patent, this tool would never be public. 

[[Patents can be used to block third parties]]

Patents are meant to last 30 years, after which the protected exploitation rights expire. The problem is that 30 years are not the same today than what they were 100 years ago. Moreover, patents can be issued on broad ideas even before there is even an attempt at realization. The case of [[Theranos]] may be a paradigmatic example:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Theranos%3A%20How%20a%20broken%20patent%20system%20sustained%20its%20decade-long%20deception" data-author="@arstechnica" cite="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/03/theranos-how-a-broken-patent-system-sustained-its-decade-long-deception/">
<p>But Holmes found a more receptive audience at the USPTO. She says she spent five straight days at her computer drafting a patent application. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/holmes-provisional-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provisional application</a>, filed in September 2003 when Holmes was just 19 years old, describes “medical devices and methods capable of real-time detection of biological activity and the controlled and localized release of appropriate therapeutic agents.” This provisional application would mature into many issued patents. In fact, there are patent applications still being prosecuted that claim priority back to Holmes’ 2003 submission.</p>
<p>But Holmes’ 2003 application was not a “real” invention in any meaningful sense. We know that Theranos spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars trying to develop working diagnostic devices. The tabletop machines Theranos focused on were much <em>less&nbsp;</em>ambitious than Holmes’ original vision of a patch. Indeed, it’s fair to say that Holmes’ first patent application was little more than aspirational science fiction written by an eager undergraduate.</p>

Patents must meet two criteria to be issued: **utility** and **enablement**. The latter means that the patent should suffice for someone on the same field to be able to technically realize the invention.  However, how can a patent examiner determine the *enablement* of a patent? 


[[Patents and research]] deserve a topic on its own.
