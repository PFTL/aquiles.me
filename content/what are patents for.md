# What are Patents for
Before starting a project of [[technology transfer]], I regarded [[patents]] as a roadblock to innovation. An example was the patent on 3D printing, which blocked the development of the technique even though no one was working on it. However, the spirit behind patents is that they are open, therefore everyone can see them and, consequently, build on them. 

However, from the other side of the spectrum, developing a technique involves a massive investment. If the core of a business is to commercialize a device, how can you protect that investment after you've validated the market? If anyone can jump right at the best time of the development, all the risk is absorbed by only one player. 

Patents help protect the commercial investment but do not block research innovation. It is my understanding that anyone can build on what is written in a patent provided that they don't commercialize it. In principle, a researcher's motivation is not commercial success, and therefore I see no [[conflict of interest]].
