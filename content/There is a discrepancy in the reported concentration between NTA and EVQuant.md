There is a discrepancy between measurements based on [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] and the [[EVQuant]] protocol, in which it is possible to [[quantifying the concentration of EVs in urine or plasma through confocal microscopy]] [@hartjes2020]. 

This may be due to small particles are properly characterized by NanoSight (at least when small means liposomes of 40nm). While in a fluorescent confocal microscope, with an immobilized sample, it is possible to adjust the settings to become sensitive event o single-molecules.
