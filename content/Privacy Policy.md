This website tries to respect the maximum possible [[privacy]] of its users. 

**Last Updated:** July 09 - 2020

## We don't track
We do not track the visits to the pages in any way. This is also discussed in the [[about]] page. It is not only aimed at respecting the visitors privacy, it is a core idea of a [[digital garden]] not be lead by market effects but by ones self-driven curiosity and serendipity. 

## We don't store personal data
Since we don't track hits to the website, we are also not knowingly storing any personal data. Our web hosting provider is [[netlify]], and we have no control over their logs nor infrastructure. However, we do trust them to respect the privacy of their clients and their visitors. 

### The newsletter
The only exception to storing personal is if you provide us with your e-mail to join the newsletter. In such case, we use a service called [[Substack]], that will handle the sign up, unsubscribe, and delivery of our weekly newsletter. We only collect **your email** and only in case **you willingly give it to us**. You will be able to unsubscribe at any moment for any reason

#### Cookies
The website overall does not store any cookies on your computer, but the form to subscribe to the newsletter does only after you have confirmed your subscription. The cookies stored are only safety cookies, that prevent abuses of the sign up form. They are not meant to track users from one page to the other nor from one visit to the other.
