# Privacy Policy
This website tries to respect the maximum possible [[privacy]] of its users. 

**Last Updated:** July 09 - 2020

## I don't track
I do not track the visits to the pages in any way. This is also discussed in the [[about]] page. It is not only aimed at respecting the visitors privacy, it is a core idea of a [[digital garden]] not be lead by market effects but by ones self-driven curiosity and serendipity. 

## I don't store personal data
Since [[I don't track the visitors]] to the website, I am not knowingly storing any personal data. The web hosting provider is [[netlify]], and I have no control over their logs nor infrastructure. However, I do trust them to respect the privacy of their clients and their visitors. 

### The newsletter
I have paused the newsletter after serious concerns regarding [[Substack privacy policy]], and their [[Substack wants to scoop as much information as they can|scooping data policy]].

#### Cookies
The website overall does not store any cookies on your computer, but the form to subscribe to the newsletter does only after you have confirmed your subscription. The cookies stored are only safety cookies, that prevent abuses of the sign up form. They are not meant to track users from one page to the other nor from one visit to the other.
