## Welcome to my corner of the internet
[[This website is not a blog]] in the traditional sense. It is my attempt at [[learning in public]], and building [[a healthier internet]]. You can learn more [[about me]], and the [[things I've done]].

The only way to navigate through the website is by following links. These are some starting points that may be of interest:

- [[After a Failure Revert to the Last Known Working State]]
- Can you [[revert to the last known working state]] also in the real-life?
- Do you want to learn [[How can a newsletter track you]]?
- Or perhaps you want do discuss about the role of [[Democracy and algorithms]]?

### Work in Progress
These are some of the things I am working on [[now]], feel free to comment to expand my knowledge:

- [[Guide on how to open-source projects]] <- This is [[work in progress]]
- [[Designing electronics]] is a joyful (and time consuming) task
- I am thinking about the [[digital garden tos]], help me figure out how to behave in this space!

## Terms of Digital Gardening
Reading this website is a two-way commitment between the writer (me), and the reader (you). But [[digital garden TOS]] are not a standard for websites. What I write here is fluid, meaning that is prone to mistakes and changes of perspective. However, I mean what I write, just that every note has a different degree of confidence, regardless of how it sounds. I try to focus on the bigger arguments, but it is very well possible that you catch me following a fallacy. Just use [[the comments]], [[contact me]], engage in a fruitful discussion that can make us both better.
