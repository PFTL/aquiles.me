# Welcome to Aquiles.me

I am a physicist, after finishing my [[PhD]] I transitioned out of [[academia]] by starting my own business as a freelance [[software]] [[developer]] and [[trainer]]. Later, together with other partners, we started a company to build devices to measure the [[size of nanoparticles]]. 

In this pages you will find my thoughts on a lot of different topics, ranging from [[technology transfer]], to building [[websites]], dancing [[tango]], and everything in between. 

## About this website

This website is highly experimental. It was born out of a simple idea: writing articles on a personal website should not be about collecting them in order, but about linking them. 

Therefore, you won't find an index, nor a chronological list. The only way to navigate through the website is by following links. I discuss more on the [[about]] page, where you can read why I decided to experiment with this. 

If you are looking for a more traditional approach to a personal website, you can always head to [Aquicarattino.com](https://www.aquicarattino.com), my other website.

If you are curious, you can read [[how I built this website]], it is [[open source]].

### The newsletter

I opened the possibility of subscribing to a [[newsletter]] because I wanted to experiment with sharing what I have been doing and discovering. It has a monthly periodicity, to which I would like to stick.
