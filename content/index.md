description: This is the place where I think and learn in public. From science to technology and the world.

# Welcome to Aquiles.me
This is my little corner of the internet. I like to learn and think about many things and these pages are my way of making the process public. You can always check what I am doing [[now]], or uncover some threads by following links. 

First, remember that [[this website is not a blog]]. It was built as an experiment of [[learning in public]]. The only way to navigate through the website is by following links. If you want some starting points, you can learn more [[about me]], take a look at my [[2020 goals]] or get started with one of these seeds:

- [[If you are in a position of power and don't do anything, nothing will change]]
- [[Democracy and algorithms]]
- [[How can a newsletter track you]]
- [[Why backlinks are the core of my digital garden]]
- [[Guide on how to open-source projects]] <- This is [[work in progress]]

## Terms of Digital Gardening
Reading this website is a two-way commitment between the writer (me), and the reader (you). But [[digital garden TOS]] are not a standard for websites. What I write here is fluid, meaning that is prone to mistakes and changes of perspective. However, I mean what I write, just that every note has a different degree of confidence, regardless of how it sounds. I try to focus on the bigger arguments, but it is very well possible that you catch me following a fallacy. Just use [[the comments]], [[contact me]], engage in a fruitful discussion that can make us both better. 

## My Newsletter
I am particularly concerned about [[how to create a healthier internet]], that is why I am self-hosting my [newsletter](https://aquicarattino.com/newsletter/aqui-carattino/subscribe/). If you want to keep up to date to the things I think and write about, just sign up by [clicking here](https://aquicarattino.com/newsletter/aqui-carattino/subscribe/). There is no commitment on frequency yet.
