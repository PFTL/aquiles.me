# Welcome to Aquiles.me

If you just want to have a glimpse, check out what am I doing [[now]].

[[This website is not a blog]], there is no index, no [[rss feed]], no timeline. It was built as a way of [[learning in public]]. Most of the things you'll find in here are short notes, but some evolve into articles, over time. 

The only way to navigate through the website is through [[links]]. If you want some starting points, you can check, for example, what I write:

- About [[Python]]
- About [[academia]]
- You can check [[how i built this website]]
- Or you may be interested in learning more [[about me]]

If you are looking for a more traditional approach to a personal website, you can always head to [Aquicarattino.com](https://www.aquicarattino.com), my other website.

## The newsletter

I opened the possibility of subscribing to a [[newsletter]] because I wanted to experiment with sharing what I have been doing and discovering. Since the website has no RSS feed, I thought it would be nice to be able to ping people with similar interests.
