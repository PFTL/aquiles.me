description: This is the place where I think and learn in public. From science to technology and the world.

# Welcome to Aquiles.me
This is my little corner of the internet. I like to learn and think about many things and these pages are my way of making the process public. You can always check what I am doing [[now]], or uncover some threads by following links. 

First, remember that [[this website is not a blog]]. It was built as an experiment of [[learning in public]]. The only way to navigate through the website is by following links. If you want some starting points, you can check, for example, these articles:

- [[If you are in a position of power and don't do anything, nothing will change]]
- [[Democracy and algorithms]]
- [[Guide on how to open-source projects]]
- Or you may be interested in learning more [[about me]]

## My Newsletter
I am particularly concerned about [[how to create a healthier internet]], that is why I am self-hosting my [newsletter](https://aquicarattino.com/newsletter/aqui-carattino/subscribe/). If you want to keep up to date to the things I think and write about, just sign up by [clicking here](https://aquicarattino.com/newsletter/aqui-carattino/subscribe/).
