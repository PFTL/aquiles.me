# Welcome to Aquiles.me

I am a physicist who currently is building a device to measure the [[size of nanoparticles]]. On my free time I build [[websites]], dance [[tango]], and more. 

## About this website

This website is highly experimental. It was born out of a simple idea: writing articles on a personal website should not be about collecting them in order, but about linking them. 

Therefore, you won't find an index, nor a list. The only way to navigate through the website is by following links. I discuss more on the [[about]] page, where you can read why I decided to experiment with this. 

If you are looking for a more traditional approach to a personal website, you can always head to [Aquicarattino.com](https://www.aquicarattino.com), my other website.

If you are curious, you can read [[how i built this website]], it is [[open source]].

### The newsletter

I opened the possibility of subscribing to a [[newsletter]] because I wanted to experiment with sharing what I have been doing and discovering. It has a monthly periodicity, to which I would like to stick.
