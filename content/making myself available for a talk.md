# Making Myself Available for a Talk
Inspired by [Andr√© Marques-Smith](https://andremarques-smith.com/), I decided to make myself available to [[Talk to Me]] for a couple of hours every Friday afternoon. I think it is a very interesting **experiment** and a clear way of giving back to the community. My biggest concern is what *community* am I targeting, which would be highly dependent on my existing network of people. 

The topics I am expecting to cover are functional to myself as well: [[open source]], which will help me tune the [[Guide on how to open-source projects]], and [[Technology Transfer]] understood as [[entrepreneurship for scientists]], which will give me enough inside knowledge to keep growing concepts in this area. And a broad topic about career choices for scientists, of which I am uncertain, but that would have been to have available when I was making the call. 

## Success would be
I would define success at this stage if I manage to have at least 2 talks per month, and if I feel that I could deliver enough value to whoever joins the talks. 

## Future Steps
Even though I am not limiting who can ask for a meeting, I am targeting scientists. I could expand the group of people I am targeting, such as people working in companies (Python code-reviews could be one possibility). This puts me in the path of actually charging money for my time, and I believe I am not-yet-ready for this.
