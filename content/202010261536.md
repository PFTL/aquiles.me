Even though @Fo2020 claims that tracking in [[hollow core fibers]] instead of [[hollow optical fiber]] can increase the throughput, their results show that they managed to track just 100 particles and not all of them for sufficiently long times even if they were using non-diluted samples. One must but question the validity of their claims, such that 

> The number of particles that can be measured in parallel is more than one order of magnitude higher than in previous reports about tracking in optofluidic fibers.
