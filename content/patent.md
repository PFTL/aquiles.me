Patents are a bureaucratic process to secure exclusivity on an idea, process, or product. Patents have a two fold official effect: they are meant to lower the [[risk]] of [[innovation]] by limiting competition. They are also public, which means that others can use them to learn and build upon them. 

Some products are not patented exactly to keep them secret, especially because patents are granted for finite amounts of time.
