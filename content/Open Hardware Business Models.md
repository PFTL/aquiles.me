[[Open Hardware]] is a way of sharing knowledge that is slowly taking root in different disciplines. It is in a sense the extension of [[open source]] software to the physical world. However, hardware and software have very different potentials and caveats which are worth exploring in detail to understand the full potential that each can bring. 

Software, at least since the massive adoption of the internet, has an extremely low (if not zero) [[marginal cost]]. This means that the economy of scale does not apply to software as it does for hardware. If we were to produce a single cell phone, its costs would be astronomical, but if we plan on selling millions, the costs per unit fall dramatically. 

And scale is not a minor feature when thinking about electronics. [[Arduino]] is a paradigmatic example of open hardware. But they have a peculiarity: if I want to build my own board, the costs are going to be much higher than the costs the company has, simply because of the scale of its production. And it can even go further: since the means of producing electronics are pretty much commoditized, the only way of cutting costs is lowering quality.
