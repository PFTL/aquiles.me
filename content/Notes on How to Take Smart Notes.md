# Notes on "How to Take Smart Notes"

[[How to Take Smart Notes - Sönke Ahrens|How to Take Smart Notes]] is a great starting point for anyone interested in learning how to store knowledge in the long run. The book focuses on people who have the objective of writing non-fiction, and therefore it is an ideal resource for someone starting a longer-term project, such as a Ph.D. or a master. In any case, the note-taking process itself can be valuable regardless of your end goal. 

The method proposed in the book follows to the letter [[The Luhmann method]], also knows as [[Zettelkasten method]]. The [[note taking]] process is structured in different ways. First, there are different categories of notes:

- **Transient Notes** are the initial point. They are short and hold any ideas we have. Transient notes are meant to be reviewed quickly and we must decide whether they deserve to be transformed into a permanent note o discarded. 
- **Literature Notes** are based on what we read. They are an abstraction of the knowledge we can extract from a book or a paper. They are meant to hold information based on a single source, and they should be written with our own words, not a plain copy/pasting
- **Permanent Notes** hold our ideas, they are the evolution of the transient notes and ideally should link to other permanent notes or literature notes in order to build a web of knowledge. 

There is also a lot of thought put into defining how each note should look like. The core idea is that each note should express a single idea. Therefore, when we refer to one of them, we are referring to a concrete concept and not to a a sub-set within a longer note. 

The second step of the note-taking process relates to the **archiving**. [[The Luhmann method]] is efficient as long as the archival and retrieval process is efficient. Therefore, instead of keeping notes in a chronological order, Ahrens proposes to keep notes based on their links to each other. With paper notes, this means that every time we are going to store a note we must decide where to put it. Ideally we will place it right behind the note it relates to most to. 

If we add a smart numbering to the notes we can start referring to them from other notes. And here is where the key aspect of the method lies: building links between notes every time we store a new one is what creates value and new insight. For digital note taking, a link is what it sounds. For paper-based ones, links are references, such as ``see note 365ab1``. 

The book also has a collection of references to justify why this method works so well. On of the things I found more interesting is the idea of [[low friction working]]. We should not fight our methods, but we should tune our way of working to serve our purposes. If we don't like an aspect of what we do (for instance, we like writing in blue instead of black), we should be able to just doing it. 

In this direction, Ahrens proposes [[writing down as a mean to understanding what we read]]. On the one hand, changing contexts from the book, to our mind, to writing down is a good flow to build knowledge. To achieve it, we must transform what we read in view of what we already know, and this is a compounding effect. By writing down, it is also possible [[freeing short term memory]], and lower our stress over the possibility of losing fleeing thoughts. This is very similar to why [[bullet journaling]] is effective at improving productivity. 

The rest of the book is more focused on **learning** and **writing** techniques. Even though it skips the topic of [[spaced repetition]], it discusses that [[cramming is not understanding]] and therefore the roles of tests and their objective in assessing knowledge must be reviewed. It briefly covers what are the [[retrieval and storage strength]] in relation to knowledge, and they support the idea of why the Zettelkasten is a natural way of taking notes. 

When the book covers the writing process, one of the most interesting points is that we can't consider it a linear process. Ideas are naturally networked in our brains (and in the notes) (see: [[202010160912]]), and we can't make a top-down plan. What Ahrens mostly argues is that the education has system has an outdated approach to teaching planning. 

The core message for someone who wants to write a book is to have a fluid workflow (see: [[202010161703]]). An outline is useful at supporting the structure of the book, but we must be able to change it as we progress. We must [[split writing from editing]] since they engage with different parts of our brain. In the editing we will identify missing links in our thoughts, spelling mistakes, etc. Of course, all the approach is traversed by playing with the notes and their links. 

## What I Missed
The most important argument on which I completely disagree with Ahrens, is that knowledge can be built without ever looking at **reality**. The book argues that we can read books and produce more books. However, there is never a mention of the role that observation has. Someone must perform experiments, must collect data, has to go out there and see how society behaves. 

For anyone working in a lab this book will make you believe that your job is not important, while I believe it is exactly the opposite. Without someone looking at how the world looks like, there is no way of progressing in science (in any science). And this is a message that Ahrens simply does not get right. The book itself is a collection of references to experimental work (of various qualities) to justify its claims. 

The book is a seminal work in the expanding field of [[knowledge management]]. However, less than half the book is about taking notes, the rest is focused on suggestions for students and people who want to write. It does not give any actionable advice, not even from Ahrens own personal experience. Having a meta-chapter discussing how he wrote a previous chapter would have killed it. 

Finally, another important topic that is barely covered is the limitation that the Zettelkasten has. Even though Ahrens mentions the example of Darwin to challenge our own thoughts, the notes themselves are prone to a myriad of biases, and the book does not provide a single insight on how to fight them. This is mostly due to the fact that the entirety of [[How to Take Smart Notes - Sönke Ahrens]] is based on a single example (Luhmann himself). Even though the book goes to great extents to find *research* to back its claims, the most crucial aspects are single-sourced. This may be just an extreme case of [[survivorship bias]]. 

## What to Look Forward To
Digital note-taking has opened the door to many interesting new approaches.  For example, [[this website is not a blog]], but what some people call a [[digital garden]]. I have modeled my way of working in many of the ideas of [[The Luhmann method]], but adding the extra possibility of having longer, multi-topic notes, which are closer to a blog article than to a single unit of knowledge. 

The [[note taking]] space, looked at it as a discussion on how to build knowledge, is due some progress. Mostly, I believe, it's because we didn't discuss it enough. Some interesting tools are popping up, such as RoamResearch, but in many aspects I think people is falling in love with the technology and not with the method. 

[[backlinks are the core of my digital garden|Backlinks]] are just the tip of the iceberg regarding what digital means can offer. I am really eager to see what can happen when long-time learners (as opposed to young dudes from silicon valley) become willing to share their insight openly and discuss their approach.
