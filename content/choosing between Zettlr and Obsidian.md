# Choosing Between Zettlr and Obsidian
When I decided to start this [[digital garden]], I had to look around for the tools I felt confident using. I fell for [[roam research]], and liked their approach, but didn't like the fact that it is a [[subscription-based product]], plus I had several concerns about the [[privacy]] of my data. At that moment I found [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/), and started using it.

I really like the [[open source]] nature of the project, that its author is very vocal about what he is trying to accomplish. However, I found it too geared towards academic publishing. It has a great way of dealing with bibliography, and it renders markdown beautifully. However, I was not looking for a markdown editor, I was looking for a note-taking program. 

Serendipity brought me to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which defines itself as:
>Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of
a local folder of plain text Markdown files. 

It works on plain markdown files makes, therefore it is interchangeable with Zettlr. I have to acknowledge that it has a very low friction to get started, and does not focus that much on rendering and keeping a bibliography record. It lacks some features such as multi-lingual support, but it really helped me getting started. Just a blank screen, my thoughts and a keyboard. 

The biggest question, as always, is [[choosing the proper tool for the job]]. If you only want to take notes, [[Obsidian]] is great. Quick to get started, bi-directional linking, uncluttered interface. **BUT** is not open-source, which is a very big limiting factor (see: [[Choosing technology based on their incentives]]). [[Zettlr]], on the other hand, is a great tool for more complex projects beyond note-taking. You can confidently write an entire book on it, your thesis or your research papers. It is open source, and it has an interesting community around it. 

I briefly explored other options but, to be honest, nothing even reaches the bare-minimum of what I wanted for a writing tool:

- markdown based
- local storage
- low friction
- [[daily notes]]
- [[Zettelkasten notes]]

What I am missing, overall, are template-based notes, i.e. that I can start a note with a predefined template. Support for more complex linking, such as being able to use ``@`` to refer to a person. Compiling *to-do's*, *to-reads*, etc. Being able to centralized notes to easier exchange between [[daily notes]] and my [[digital garden]].
