# Choosing Between Zettlr and Obsidian
When I decided to start my [[digital garden]], I had to look around for tools I felt confident using in the long run. Also, my requirements are not those of a typical end-user, since [[how i built this website|I made my own program]] to convert the notes to a website. I was looking for something to edit notes, not to render them as a final product. 

After experimenting for a long time, I narrowed down the list of requirements for the software I use to take notes:

- Files are stored locally
- In a format that guarantees long-term compatibility (such as Markdown)
- Interface is not in the way
- Supports easy linking (such a as wikilinks)
- No need for including many figures
- *Some* support for equations 
- *Some* support for references

Now, I left the last two points to the end because I don't use those features every day, but I do require them once in a while. And the same with the figures. 

I have explored many different programs, and none reaches to the level of either [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). But they are different to each other and that is what I wanted to discuss. 

First, [[Zettlr]] is [[open source]] and I believe in [[choosing technology based on their incentives]]. I have actually used parts of the code of Zettlr to understand how to parse markdown and render this very website. [[Obsidian]] is not open source and probably will never be. 

In any case, they both store files locally, work with markdown and the interface is clean. Obsidian is more minimalistic than Zettlr. They both support quick links with the wikilink format, although Zettlr offers a bit more of configuration on how they look like (adding text, referencing by title, etc.) Obsidian offers bidirectional links, and a network graph to see how notes are linked to each other. It may sound like a minor feature, but it is great to quickly find orphan notes, or put several together. 

Up to this point, my favorite to use on a daily basis is Obsidian. Zettlr employs too many resources into making the rendering of the markdown files. Zettlr could fall into the category of an authoring tool for end products, such as a report, a paper or even a book. You can export notes to different formats, and more. 

As I said at the beginning, I am not interested in those features and it somehow permeates to the interface. I find searching through notes easier on Obsidian, and simply writing has a [[lower the barrier to writing|lower barrier]]. Zettlr calls itself a markdown *editor*, and that was not what I was after. 

But, there is a big but. Zettlr is geared towards academic work. Which means it bundles some very nice features: it renders equations written in LaTeX, and it handles bibliographic databases straight out of Zotero. This is not included in Obsidian and probably it'll never be, since their target customers are elsewhere. 

I've reached a compromise: I take *most* notes using Obsidian. Because it feels quick and unintrusive. But if I need to take literature notes (such as [[Sources of error in measuring Brownian Motion|this one]]) that require more equations and proper handling of citations, I use Zettlr directly. 

Parsing the notes for rendering as a website is done by my own program, and I must confess that I barely look at it. I trust that the pages are looking OK or that someone will warn me if not. [[a new way of blogging|Splitting creation from publishing]] gave me a new influx of energy to start actively maintaining a website.
