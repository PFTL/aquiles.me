# Choosing Between Zettlr and Obsidian
When I decided to start this [[digital garden]], I had to look around for the tools I felt confident using. I tried [[roam research]], and liked their approach. However, I didn't like that it is a [[subscription-based product]], plus I had several concerns about the [[user privacy online|privacy]] of my data. 

I have very specific requirements for the programs I use to take notes:

- Files should be stored locally
- In a format that guarantees long-term compatibility, such as Markdown
- Interface should not be in the way
- Should support easy linking (such a as wikilinks)
- No need for including many figures
- Some support for equations 
- Some support for references

Now, I left the last two points to the end because I don't use those features every day, but I do require them once in a while. 

I have explored many different programs, and none reaches to the level of either [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). But they are different to each other and that is what I wanted to discuss. 

First, [[Zettlr]] is [[open source]] and I believe in [[choosing technology based on their incentives]]. I have actually used parts of the code of Zettlr to understand how to parse markdown and render this very website. [[Obsidian]] is not open source and probably will never be. 

In any case, they both store files locally, work with markdown and the interface is clean. Obsidian is more minimalistic than Zettlr. They both support quick links with the wikilink format, although Zettlr offers a bit more of configuration on how they look like (adding text, referencing by title, etc.) Obsidian offers bidirectional links, and a network graph to see how notes are linked to each other. It may sound like a minor feature, but it is great to quickly find orphan notes, or put several together. 

Up to this point, my favorite to use on a daily basis is Obsidian. Zettlr employs too many resources into making the presentation of the markdown files. It offers to export to different formats, and more. However, I am not interested in those features and it somehow permeates to the interface. I find searching through notes easier on Obsidian, and simply writing has a [[lower the barrier to writing|lower barrier]]. Zettlr calls itself a markdown editor, and that was not what I was after. 

But, there is a big but. Zettlr is geared towards academic work. Which means it bundles some very nice features: it renders equations written in LaTeX, and it handles bibliographic databases straight out of [[Zotero]]. This is not included in Obsidian (and probably it'll never be, since their target customers are elsewhere). 

I've reached a compromise: I take *most* notes using Obsidian. Because it feels quick, unintrusive. But if I need to take literature notes (such as [[Sources of error in measuring Brownian Motion|this one]]) that require more equations and proper handling of citations, I use Zettlr directly. 

It is not ideal, but the end result is convenient.
