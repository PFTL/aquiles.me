[[Mike Caulfield]][^1] talks about the garden or the stream as a reference to how we consume and produce content online. The core idea is that a stream is what we are most used to. Streams are Twitter and Facebook feeds. But they are also blogs. One article comes after the other (see: [[breaking the chronological order]]). In this stream we can't build on our opinions, we can just keep posting. Streams flow past us. 

On the other hand, [[digital garden|gardens]] are multi-purpose and they change with the perspective of whoever is watching and them. They change over time through seasons, they change if one moves to a new spot. With this idea, websites such as Wikipedia are gardens. They change depending on where we start, what path we follow, what drives us to follow it, etc. 

There is a path in between, which is called the [[federated wiki]], in which streams are put into context by embedding themselves into other people's websites. This is already similar to a blog post in which the author starts by commenting other's views, but in a systematic, transparent way.
