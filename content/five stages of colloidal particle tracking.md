The process of [[nanoparticle tracking]] can be split in 5 steps:

- Correcting: See [[image restoration for nanoparticle tracknig]]
- Locating: See [[locating particles for nanoparticle tracking]]
- Refining: See [[refining the position of nanoparticles on an image]]
- Discriminating: See: [[discriminating particles for tracking analysis]]
- Linking: See: [[linking particle positions to form trajectories]]
