# Dark Forest Theory

I came across this idea[^1] [^2] by [[Yancey Strickler]], that proposes that the [[overload of information]] is pushing us to spaces with restricted access. Instead of sharing publicly on Facebook, we have Whatsapp groups, Slack channels, etc. The idea was developed amidst the discussion about [[Russian meddling in the US election]]. 

I can relate to some of the points, but I also think it is a very superficial read on the overall feeling, especially if one takes into account younger (and older) people. The ~40 year olds of 2020 are the hinge generation. However, some aspects of what the article discusses may be hinting to the approach [[Facebook]] has on 'privacy': creating groups to which one must be accepted to join.
